Pincode based serviceability allows merchants to define the pincodes where they can deliver their products &amp; services. Merchants define the pincodes they serve and buyer apps verify whether a particular pincode (of buyer) can be served. This requires an optimal data structure for storing the pincode by merchant to verifiy in near real-time.
